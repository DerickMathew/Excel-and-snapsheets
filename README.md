#### History:
----
I was interested by a concept that [Matt Parker](https://twitter.com/standupmaths) made and used as a part of a video he put up on youtube (subscribe to his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths), you wont regret it). He also mentions this in his book "[Things to make and do in the fourth dimension](http://makeanddo4d.com/) ". Long story short I always wanted to make it coz well i thought it was fun but i put it off until a couple of my friends pushed me to make it. Sooo yeah there you have it the app and the story behind it!!!
